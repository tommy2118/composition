        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Conclusion: Embracing Composition</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout this guide, we’ve explored the challenges of inheritance and the flexibility of composition. By refactoring
            rigid inheritance hierarchies into modular, reusable components, we can build systems that are easier to maintain
            and adapt to changing requirements.

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Composition encourages the creation of smaller, reusable components that can be combined to achieve complex functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Behaviors can be added, removed, or modified without impacting unrelated parts of the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Composition makes it easier to extend systems to handle new requirements without introducing fragility.</li>
            <li><strong>Adherence to SOLID Principles:</strong> Refactoring to composition often aligns code with the Single Responsibility and Open/Closed principles.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Real-World Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Many modern frameworks and libraries embrace composition as a core design principle. From React’s functional components
            to Ruby’s modules and Python’s mixins, composition has proven its value in building scalable, maintainable software.

        Future-Ready Systems:
        ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐

</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            By adopting composition, you future-proof your applications, ensuring they remain robust and adaptable in the face
            of evolving requirements.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Start by identifying areas in your codebase where inheritance might be creating unnecessary complexity or fragility.
            Experiment with refactoring these areas to use composition, and observe the impact on code readability and maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, refactoring is an iterative process. Begin small, write tests to ensure functionality remains intact, and
            gradually embrace composition as a design philosophy.
